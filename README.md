# Markdown to HTML Converter

This is a simple, single-page web application designed to convert Markdown content from `input.md` into beautifully rendered HTML using the `marked` JavaScript library and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

-   **Live Markdown Conversion:** Automatically fetches `input.md` and renders it as HTML.
-   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent and responsive layout across various devices.
-   **Single File Deployment:** All necessary code (HTML, CSS via CDN, JS via CDN) is contained within a single `index.html` file for easy deployment.

## Usage

To use this application, ensure you have the following files in the same directory:

-   `index.html`: The main application file (provided in this repository).
-   `input.md`: Your Markdown file that you wish to convert and display.

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. The application will automatically fetch and display the content of `input.md` as HTML.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the page structure.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsive design.
-   **Marked.js:** A powerful Markdown parser and compiler for JavaScript.
